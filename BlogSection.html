                <strong>WEEK 1</strong> <br>
                <br>
                This week we were given 2 readings to pick. I chose the Library of Babel by Borges. What I understood or took away from this reading was that the author who was essentially narrating his exploration of the somewhat infinite library. He talked about how you could find any type of book with any word combinations. To me it felt as though he was referring a lot to the way in which the mind works which sort of resembles the way the internet also functions. Its like a never ending spiral of learning. <br>
                <br>
                This week I mainly focused on setting up. I had a bit of difficulty setting up GitHub but managed to get around it after watching the quick tutorial provided by Andre and a bit of extra help from peers. I still don’t properly know my way around it but there’s more than enough time to figure it out.<br>
                <br>
                This week we were tasked with picking 2 websites that we liked and disliked. I personally picked 4Anime as a website I liked and chose Artbreeder as a site I disliked. I dislike Artbreeder because the background looks incomplete and the fonts look out of place. Also, aesthetically it sort of sucks. I like 4Anime because of how simple it is to use, plus the dark background makes it easier to focus when watching stuff. It also has cool features like bookmarking and a randomisation button for when you don’t know what to watch. <br>
                <br>
                My goal for this module is to be comfortable enough to not only explore beyond what is being taught in class, but to also understand what is being taught.

                <strong>WEEK 2</strong> <br>
                <br>
                This week we focused on html. The reading we had to do was “Why You Should Choose HTML5” and Lawson, Bruce. What I got or understood from this article is that Lawson basically goes on about how much better HTML5 is compared to the previous model which is HTML4. He listed some benefits that the newer version has and one that particularly stood out to me was the free to use benefit. Often times these programs or models are owned by companies that require you to pay for an extended use of their product. HTML 5 on the other hand is not owned by anyone, which means it is a free for all application.<br>
                <br>
                This week we started learning about HTML and the basic HTML functions to get started on the website. I learned how to properly link VSC to GitHub, and how to broadcast our websites live. This week we also had an interesting lesson on wireframing and Layouts. I learned that it is essential for there to be an idea before the website is created, sort of like how an animator would scamp out their work before implementing it and turning it into an actual animation. I got to start on my design process which is more detailed if you press on the design link.<br>
                <br>
                This week I focused more on wireframing than actually starting on my website, and I have properly reserved that for week 3.

                <strong>WEEK 3</strong><br>
                <br>
                This week we started implementing CSS and HTML into our websites. This week was a bit slow for me seeing as I had to undergo one more iteration of my wireframing before I could truly begin working on my website. I could only start working later on in the week after I had consumed some of the previous weeks lectures. I got started with HTML and laying down some basics such as Headings, Sections, Links and Pages. I saved the CSS portion for week 4 in order to give myself time to fully understand the HTML basics.<br>
                <br>
                This weeks reading was Convention and Context, Mailloux, 1983. In this article, Mailloux highlights the important relationship between Convention and Context. He explains that context is needed in order for convention to occur, which loosely translates to having prior knowledge about something to avoid any miscommunications within conversations. I agree with this article because so much of our culture now mainly derives from the internet. New words and phrases are established almost everyday. It is now extremely easy for one to be offended with the slang of this generation if one does not necessarily keep up with the internet trends and word usage.<br>

                <strong>WEEK 4</strong><br>
                <br>
                This week we mainly focused on UI/UX. I found this very helpful seeing as how this week I also started using CSS to better the Mid-fidelity wireframing of my website. In the first quarter of the week I focused my attention on colour theory and re-evaluating my low-Fidelity wireframing to see whether or not the intended colours would translate well digitally. I also chose the fonts and sizes of my headings. I further explored CSS and found that a few functions in HTML are easier to use in the CSS format. What I mean by this is that instead of having to declare all my headings in bold individually, I could use CSS to encase everything using a specific class to do one function. This made the proceedings of this website a lot easier, and it makes for a less messy clutter on my individual pages.<br>
                <br>
                I also discovered extra material that further helped with the proceedings of this website. W3Schools and The Net Ninja are from many resources I have used when working on this website.

                <strong>WEEK 7</strong><br>
                <br>
                This weeks reading was Hassenzahl and Tractinsky - 2006 - User experience - a research agenda. This reading basically highlighted the importance of UX and how it has become necessary over the years. The article also provides a way in which UX can be researched, measured and evaluated. The reading also gives insight of how THE EXPERIENTAL, THE EMOTION AND EFFECT, and BEYOND THE INSTRAMENTAL work together to create a balanced idea of what UX should be.<br>
                <br>
                This week I carried on with the development of my website. I replaced a temporary background colour with a new background image that I felt is best suitable for my website. I also started thinking of ways in which the website could reflect who I am visually and settled on a green and white aesthetic. I also began setting up my GitHub properly in order to be able to submit or publish to main.
                <br>
                I ran into a few challenges, mainly dealing with the CSS. I had issues regarding margins and spacing that took an annoying amount of time to fully fix. <br>
                <br>
                After I essentially finished implementing everything individually in a separate project, I started transferring these different components and exercises I have been doing to an new project. I have run into other errors and setbacks which will be properly tackled in the design section of the website.
